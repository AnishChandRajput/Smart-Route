#  AI Pathfinding Project

**Developed by:** Anish Chand Rajput & Shivang Kumar  
**Course:** MCA Project  

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates how different AI algorithms can navigate and find paths in a virtual city map. Users can interact with the project via a web interface and choose between:

- **A\* Algorithm** ⭐
- **Blind Search Algorithm** 🧭
- **Depth First Search (DFS)** 🤖

The algorithms are implemented in Python using `pygame` for visualization, and the interface is built with **Flask** and HTML/CSS.

## Features

1. **Interactive Web Interface:** Select the algorithm and visualize its execution.
2. **AI Algorithms Implemented:**  
   - A* Pathfinding  
   - Blind Search  
   - Depth First Search (DFS)
3. **Real-time Visualization:** Watch the algorithm explore the grid and reach the target.
4. **Modular Code:** Each algorithm has its separate Python script for clarity and maintainability.
